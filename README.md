# Overview
While learning C++, I decided to try and create a Tic-Tac-Toe game that would run inside the console. C++ is a unique variation of the C programming 
language that sort of expands upon the original language and changes a few things around. For example, instead of being a structural language like C, C++
is an object-oriented language that takes advantage of polymorphism, encapsulation, data abstraction, and other concepts having to do with classes. 

I felt as though tic-tac-toe would be the perfect game to practice C++ in. It plays like regular tic-tac-toe where you, the player, have control of 
X's, while the computer you play against has control of the O's. The first person to get their respective letters 3 in a row (whether horizontal, vertical
or diagonal) wins the game.

# Development Environment

I used Code Blocks as my virtual environment, since I had already downloaded it for something unrelated, and I had already known it would support C and C++

For this project, I used C++ as my main language, and I used the ctime and random plugins.

# Future Work

- Maybe instead of having it play on the console, I could have this program actually open a window with tic-tac-toe
- I could also implement 2-player mode, where instead of playing against a computer, you could play with someone physical to you. 
- I don't know if this is a problem with my code, or a problem with my virus protection, but whenever I run the program, it'll open two windows, and the first window will close prematurely.
